## Overview

SEOpie is a comprehensive Python-based utility designed to analyze various aspects of a website's SEO performance. This tool provides a JSON report detailing the results of the analyses. The overall SEO score calculation is typically a weighted combination of various factors that contribute to a website's search engine optimization. While the exact method of calculating the SEO score can vary depending on the implementation, below is a general overview of how an overall SEO score might be calculated.


------------

### Technical SEO:

#### Scoring The Factors

For each factor, the tool will score the website on a scale (e.g., 0 to 100). For example:

```
Meta Information: 85

Content Quality: 70

Page Structure: 90

Technical SEO: 80

External Factors: 60

Readability: 75

User Experience: 80

Multiply each factorâ€™s score by its weight and sum the results:
Overall SEO Score = 
(85 * 0.20) + (70 * 0.25) + (90 * 0.15) + 
(80 * 0.20) + (60 * 0.10) + (75 * 0.05) + (80 * 0.05)

The weighted scores are summed to get the overall SEO score. For the example above:

Overall SEO Score = 
17 + 17.5 + 13.5 + 16 + 6 + 3.75 + 4 = 77.75

```

Customization: The weightings and factors can be customized based on the priorities of your specific needs. SEO is constantly evolving, so the factors and their importance may change over time.
